    They seem to have really strong bonds. When in captivity, they are only calm if
    all three of them are together. But once they found a way out again and are roaming
    the hallways, they split up and make it as hard as possible for me to find them.
    In addition, I can''t keep them in the cage for long unless I catch all three
    within minutes. Doesn''t help that we can''t figure out what they eat. Or if.
    Smart little creatures. I really wish there was a way to comminicate with them.
    Explain. Ask.'
