  pageText: "Wednesday\nI hope Bob can get the damn lense to last longer really soon.
    It's so annoying to always switch them and anyway, any creature I might have catched
    in the first round is already long gone as soon as the new lense is in place.
    Unless I can get a hold of all three within the lifetime of one lense. \n\nMonday\nWhen
    I look at Olivia, I don't know what to think. She's changed so much. IT has changed
    her. She says it doesn't hurt, says it's barely a tickle, but I don't believe
    her. She's not as good at controlling her face as she thinks she is. I hate being
    in there when we power it up. Everbody else does, too."
