  pageText: "Thursday\nWe finally found a way. Well, Laura did. She barely talks anymore.
    No wonder. Don't really know, how I feel about this. They don't seem to be affected
    in any way, but how can we know for sure? Olivia says they don't feel like we
    do. I'm pretty certain they don't want to be used like that though. Who would?
    And what right do we have to do this? But these questions are not asked aloud.
    \n\nWednesday \nHow can Olivia claim they 'don't mind' when at least twice a week
    they escape I have to go catch them?\n\nSaturday \nThey seem to have really strong
    bonds. When in captivity, they are only calm when all three of them are together.
    Try\n"
