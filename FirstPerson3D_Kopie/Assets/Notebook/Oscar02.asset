  pageText: "catching only one or two and they will escape within minutes. So I have
    to manage finding all of them really quick to even get a chance to bring them
    all back up. Once they found a way out again and are roaming the hallways, they
    spilt up though, as if to make it as hard as possible fpr me. Smart little creatures.
    We have not yet figured out what they eat, either. Or if. \n\nWednesday \nI hope
    that Bob can get the damn lense to last longer that a few minutes very soon, or
    maybe even install big filters in front of the ceiling lamps. It's really annoying
    to always switch off the lights, screw a new filter on and be on such a timelimit
    while 'hunting'.\n\nMonday\nWhen I look at Olivia, I don't know"
