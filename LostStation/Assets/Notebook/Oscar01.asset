  pageText: "Thursday\nWe finally found a way. Well, Laura did. And she hardly talks
    anymore. No wonder. Don't really know, how I feel about this. They don't seem
    to be affected in any way, but how can we know for sure? Olivia says they don't
    feel like we do. I'm pretty certain they don't want to be used like that though.
    Who would? And what right do we have to do this? But nobody asks that aloud.\n\nWednesday
    \nHow can Olivia say they 'don't mind' when at least twice a week they escape
    and I have to go catch them?"
